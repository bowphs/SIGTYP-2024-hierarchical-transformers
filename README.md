# SIGTYP

This project uses poetry for dependency management. A simple `poetry install` should recreate our environment, and you are good to go.

To run our code, edit the paths according to your needs and run the script of interest with `poetry run python scriptname.py`. You can also create a `config.py` file in which you specify arguments and hyperparameters.

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to [reach out](mailto:riemenschneider@cl.uni-heidelberg.de).
